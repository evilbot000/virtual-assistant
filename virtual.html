        Introduction
    </h2>
    <h4>
        The Virtual Assistant project is an innovative demonstration of my coding skills and practical application of several Python libraries. In this project, I've created a voice-controlled assistant capable of performing various tasks based on voice commands.

    <h2>
        Technologies Used
    </h2>
    <h4>
        SpeechRecognition Library: Used to recognize and convert spoken language into text.
        <br>
        pyttsx3 Library: Employed for text-to-speech conversion, allowing the assistant to respond audibly.
        <br>   
        pywhatkit Library: Utilized for searching and playing YouTube videos.
        <br>
        datetime Library: Integrated to provide real-time information about the current time and date.
        <br>
        wikipedia Library: Incorporated to enable the assistant to fetch brief summaries from Wikipedia.
    </h4>
    <br>
    <h2>
        Special Features
    </h2>
    <h4>
    <b>Voice Recognition:</b>
    <br>
The core of this project is voice recognition. The assistant listens for voice commands and converts them into text for further processing.
<br>
<b>Audio Feedback:</b>
<br>
The assistant provides audio feedback by converting text responses into speech, creating a more interactive user experience.

        Command Capabilities
    </h2>
<h4>
Play Music:
<br>
 By saying "play" followed by a song name, the assistant searches and plays the requested music video on YouTube.
<br>
 Retrieve Time:
 <br> 
 Responds with the current time.
<br>
 Retrieve Date: 
 <br>
 Provides the current date.
 <br>
Interaction:
<br> 
Responds politely to general questions like "How are you?" and "What is your name?"
<br>
Wikipedia Search:
<br>
 Can answer questions by fetching information from Wikipedia. Simply say "Who is" followed by a person's name.
